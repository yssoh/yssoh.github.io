<hr>

<p>To replicate the results of the numerical experiments on natural images, use the following links <a href="numexp.zip">here (.zip file)</a>, and <a href="numexp.tar.gz">here (.tar.gz file)</a>.   These experiments take a long time to replicate -- they were executed on a 16-core cloud computing service when writing this paper. </p>

<p>The files provided above omit the image patches generation stage. To replicate the patches generation process, use these links <a href="patches.zip">here (.zip file)</a>, and <a href="patches.tar.gz">here (.tar.gz file)</a> instead. </p>

<p>Please contact me if you run into issues.  Please also contact me if you have interest in developing software based on this paper.</p>
