<b>Energy Efficiency in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks.</b> <br>

<p>One method of meeting the ever increasing demands for seamless cellular traffic is to overlay the network with small base-stations. These base-stations function like the traditional base-stations except that they operate on far smaller localities and they provide traffic in places people need it most. This work investigates the energy efficiency, defined as the throughput per watt, of operating small base-stations in the network. Our main modeling tool is using stochastic geometry, which allows us to obtain neat expressions that characterize the energy efficiency in the network. These expressions are useful because they provide some rule-of-thumbs in designing networks, and can also be used as a mathematical framework for analyzing other spatial networks. </p>

<b>A Cognitive-Hybrid Division Duplex Scheme for Two-Tier Cellular Networks.</b> <br>

<p>This project explores the possibility of combining Frequency Division Duplex, favored for its ???, with Time Division Duplex, favored for its ability to adjusting downlink times to uplink times ratio frequently, in cellular networks.</p>
