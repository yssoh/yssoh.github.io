I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/">Department of Mathematics</a> at the <a href="http://nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore (NUS).

I am primarily interested in mathematical optimization with a focus on problems inspired by applications in the data sciences. I am interested in developing optimization-based methodology for a range of data processing problems, as well as understanding the performance and limitations of widely used optimization-based methods in the data sciences.
	
Note: If you are a prospective graduate student interested in working with me, please apply through the NUS Mathematics graduate program or the NUS IORA program. If you are a prospective post-doctoral student, you may contact me directly.  

Between Nov '18 to Dec '20, I was a Research Scientist at the Institute of High Performance Computing at A*STAR.  I obtained my PhD in Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACM) from the <a href = "http://www.cms.caltech.edu/">Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS)</a> at the <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology (Caltech)</a> in 2018.  My advisor is <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~venkatc/">Venkat Chandrasekaran</a>.  Before that, I was as a Research Engineer at the <a href = "http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/">Institute for Infocomm Research</a> from 2011 to 2012 under the supervision of <a href="http://people.sutd.edu.sg/~tonyquek/">Tony Quek</a>, and also in collaboration with <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QG9iXtUAAAAJ&hl=en">Marios Kountouris</a>.  I obtained my BA in <a href = "http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/">Mathematics</a> from the <a href = "http://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a> (UK) in 2011.  

I serve in the Singapore International Mathematical Olympiad committee.  The committee oversees training of high school students to represent Singapore at the <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/default.aspx">International Mathematical Olympiad</a>.  You can find out more about the committee <a href="https://sms.math.nus.edu.sg/Simo/Simo.htm">here</a>.
