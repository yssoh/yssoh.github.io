This folder contains the code for replicating the numerical results in 
``Fitting Tractable Convex Sets to Support Function Evauations''

= TO RUN =
To replicate the run the scripts Experiment_*.m as it is.

= DEPENDENCIES = 
While the procedures for computing the projection maps that specify the
estimator are themselves standalone (codes/vertexfit_lp.m, 
codes/vertexfit_sdp.m), the procedures for computing the Least Squares
Estimate (LSE) and the codes for displaying figures are not.  In 
particular, the code for computing the LSE is based on solving a convex
program proposed by Gardner and Kiderlen, and it requires the CVX parser 
along with a solver (e.g. SDPT3) to be installed.

The display of the figures also require the solution of a convex program,
and thus CVX, as well as a third party code called icosphere for creating
a regular-mesh on the 3d sphere

The file icosphere.m should be downloaded from this link and placed in the
folder /codes/
