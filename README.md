### About me

I am Research Scientist in the <a href="http://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc">Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC)</a>.  I am also an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.math.nus.edu.sg/"> Department of Mathematics</a> at the <a href="http://nus.edu.sg/"> National University of Singapore (NUS) </a>.  

I am broadly interested in optimization, signal processing, and sequential analysis.  Specifically, I am interested in understanding the role that convex optimization (and convexity in general) plays in signal processing, as well as the limits that are involved in terms of statistical inference and computation.  My most recent projects revolve the around the question of estimating a convex body from data-points.

I obtained my PhD in Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACM) from the <a href = "http://www.cms.caltech.edu/">Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS)</a> at the <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology (Caltech)</a> in 2018. My advisor is <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~venkatc/">Venkat Chandrasekaran</a>.  Before that, I was as a Research Engineer at the <a href = "http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/">Institute for Infocomm Research</a> from 2011 to 2012 under the supervision of <a href="http://people.sutd.edu.sg/~tonyquek/">Tony Quek</a>, and also in collaboration with <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QG9iXtUAAAAJ&hl=en">Marios Kountouris</a>.  I obtained my BA in <a href = "http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/">Mathematics</a> from the <a href = "http://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a> (UK) in 2011.
